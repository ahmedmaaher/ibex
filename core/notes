DCMTK integration:

You are not linking all of the libraries needed, or you are linking in wrong
order (library link order is significant!)
The DCMTK libraries have the following internal dependencies
(modules introduced with DCMTK 3.6.0 are not listed here):
    dcmdata --> ofstd
    dcmimage --> dcmimgle, dcmdata, ofstd
    dcmimgle --> dcmdata, ofstd
    dcmjpeg --> ijg8, ijg12, ijg16, dcmimage, dcmimgle, dcmdata, ofstd
    dcmnet --> dcmdata, ofstd
    dcmpstat --> dcmimage, dcmimgle, dcmsign, dcmsr, imagectn, dcmtls, dcmnet, dcmdata, ofstd
    dcmsign --> dcmdata, ofstd
    dcmsr --> dcmdata, ofstd
    dcmtls --> dcmnet, dcmdata, ofstd
    dcmwlm --> dcmnet, dcmdata, ofstd
    imagectn/dcmqrdb --> dcmnet, dcmdata, ofstd

In addition to the standard libraries, most DCMTK applications have to be
linked against the "netapi32" and "wsock32" libraries,
even if they contain no networking code.
Several external libraries such as zlib, OpenSSL etc. might also be needed.
See the INSTALL file for details.
